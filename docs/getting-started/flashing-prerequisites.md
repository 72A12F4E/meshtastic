## Overview

Before you flash your device, you may need to install drivers on your computer in order to communicate with it. Once installed, be sure to reboot your computer to verify the installation is complete.

## Prerequisites

### Verify data cord

A data cable will charge your device, but a charging cable will not be able to flash the device or communicate with it. Verify you have a data cable before proceeding. There's no official way to determine the difference in cables, trying out a few cables will be the best way to verify.

If you have a data cable, you may find that you don't need to install a driver by checking the instructions below.
