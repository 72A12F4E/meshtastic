If you're experiencing issues with updating or flashing newer versions of the Meshtastic firmware, and your LilyGo T-Echo is not running the latest bootloader version (0.6.1), updating the bootloader may resolve these problems.

To check which version of the bootloader your device is running, place the device into DFU mode by double-pressing the reset button. Then, open the mounted drive that appears on your computer and check the INFO_UF2.TXT file.

## Updating bootloader

Below are the steps to update your bootloader.

### Method 1: Using the UF2 File (Recommended)

1. Download the Latest UF2 Bootloader File for the T-Echo from [Github](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/blob/master/bin/update-lilygo_techo_bootloader-0.6.1_nosd.uf2).
2. Connect your LilyGo T-Echo to your computer via USB.
3. Activate bootloader mode by quickly double pressing the RESET button on your T-Echo. The device should appear as a removable drive on your computer.
4. Drag and drop the .uf2 file you downloaded into the T-Echo's drive. The device will automatically update the bootloader and reset.
5. Once the device resets, the update is complete. Your T-Echo is now running the latest bootloader version and you can proceed with [flashing the firmware](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/nrf52/drag-n-drop/).

### Method 2: Using adafruit-nrfutil

Should flashing the UF2 file to update your bootloader fail, you can use adafruit-nrfutil.

:::info

These instructions assume you have python and pip already installed. If you do not, please install the latest verion of python (which includes pip) from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

:::

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and install adafruit-nrfutil by running:

```bash
pip install adafruit-nrfutil
```

2. Obtain the lilygo_techo_bootloader-0.6.1.zip package from [Github](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/blob/master/bin/lilygo_techo_bootloader-0.6.1.zip).
3. Connect your LilyGo T-Echo to your computer via USB.
4. In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the bootloader zip package and execute the following command, replacing /dev/ttyACM0 with the correct port for your device (Windows users might use COMx):

```bash
adafruit-nrfutil --verbose dfu serial --package lilygo_techo_bootloader-0.6.1.zip -p /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200 --singlebank --touch 1200
```

5. Once the process finishes, the update is complete. Your T-Echo is now running the latest bootloader version and you can proceed with [flashing the firmware](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/nrf52/drag-n-drop/).
