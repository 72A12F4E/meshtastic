## Flashing Method for ESP32 Devices

1. The [Web-based installer](https://flasher.meshtastic.org) requires either Chrome or Edge browsers but is an excellent choice for quickly flashing devices.
2. The [Python Flasher](/docs/software/python/flasher) does a lot under the hood to prevent you from needing to use the terminal. It also allows you to configure your device.
3. The [CLI Script](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/esp32/cli-script) is considered the "manual process" for flashing firmware.
4. Flashing your device using an [external serial adapter](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/esp32/external-serial-adapter) should only be attempted as a last resort if no other method has been successful.
