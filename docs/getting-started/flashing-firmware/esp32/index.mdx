## Recommended Flashing Method for ESP32 Devices

For ESP32 based device users (TBEAM, TLORA, Heltec etc.) we recommend using the [web based installer](https://flasher.meshtastic.org) or the [Meshtastic Flasher application](/docs/software/python/meshtastic-flasher). The flasher application does a lot under the hood to prevent you from needing to use the terminal. It also allows you to configure your device.
