Modules are included in the firmware and allow users to extend the functionality of their mesh or device.

The list of current modules is as follows:

| Name | Description |
|:----:|:-----------:|
| Canned Message Module | Set a number of predefined messages to send out directly from the device with the use of an input device like a rotary encoder. |
| External Notification Module | Incoming messages are able to alert you using circuits you attach to the device (LEDs, Buzzers, etc) |
| Input Broker Module | Attach and define input devices such as external keyboards and rotary encoders. |
| Range Test Module | Send messages with GPS location at an interval to test the distance your devices can communicate. Requires (at least) one device set up as a sender and one as a receiver. The receiver(s) will log all incoming messages to a CSV. |
| Serial Module | Send messages across the mesh by sending strings over a serial port. |
| Store and Forward Module | Set a designated node to store messages and resend them to nodes with intermittent connection to a mesh. |
| Telemetry Module | Attach sensors to the device and transmit readings on a regular interval to the mesh. |

:::tip
Once module settings are changed, a **reset** is required for them to take effect.
