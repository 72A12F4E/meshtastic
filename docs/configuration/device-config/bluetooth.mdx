## Bluetooth Config Values

### Enabled

Enables Bluetooth.

### Pairing Mode

Specify pairing mode.

`RANDOM_PIN` generates a random PIN during runtime.
`FIXED_PIN` uses the fixed PIN that should then be additionally specified.
Finally, `NO_PIN` disables PIN authentication.

### Fixed PIN

If your pairing mode is set to `FIXED_PIN`, the default value is 123456. For all other pairing modes, this number is ignored. A custom integer (6 digits) can be set via the Bluetooth config options.

### Default Pairing Mode

The default pairing mode will be determined based on whether the device has or does not have a screen attached to it during the first boot (or with a stale device state) unless manually configured via the Bluetooth config options. 

- **Screen Attached:** If your device boots up for the first time (or with a stale device state), and a screen is detected, the default pairing mode will be set to `RANDOM_PIN`. Should the attached screen be removed after the device has already been booted, the default pairing mode of `RANDOM_PIN` will remain unless manually changed to `FIXED_PIN` or `NO_PIN`. It is recommended the pairing mode be updated prior to removing the attached screen.
- **No Screen Attached:** If your device boots up for the first time (or with a stale device state), and no screen is detected, the default paring mode will be set to `FIXED_PIN` with the aforementioned default value unless manually configured to a custom value.
