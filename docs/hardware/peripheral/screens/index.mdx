A number of devices have screens capable of displaying the messages received, information about the mesh, and other details. On powering the device it will display the Meshtastic splash screen with the version number for a couple of seconds:

The screen is split up into pages, through which you can navigate using the program button as described above. The first page to be displayed will be the message screen where received messages are displayed along with the name of the node it came from. The devices will automatically switch to this page when a new message is received.

The next pages display information about the nodes that are currently on the mesh. This includes the distance and direction to that node, the signal strength, and the time last seen.

The next page shows information about the device, battery power, current / total nodes, number of GPS satellites seen, channel name, last digits of the MAC address, and a brief log including the names of the last nodes to join the mesh.

The final page shows current battery voltage and percent charge, as well as noting how long the device has been online and the current GPS time, and GPS location.

If the device WiFi has been enabled (only possible on ESP32 devices), another page appears displaying information about the WiFi settings, IP address, and number of devices connected to the WiFi.
