To add a GPS to the RAK5005-O base board, you need the [RAK1910 GPS sensor](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-sensor/products/rak1910-max-7q-gnss-location-sensor). It is supported on slot A of the 5005 board via UART.

- uBlox MAX-7Q GPS module
- GPS and GLONASS satellite support


Further information on the RAK1910 can be found on the [RAK Documentation Center](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK1910/Overview/#product-description).

To add a GPS to the RAK19003 base board, you need the [RAK12500 GPS sensor](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-gnss-location-module-rak12500). It is supported via I<sup>2</sup>C on slot B for firmware versions 1.49 and above.

- uBlox Zoe-M8Q GNSS receiver
- GPS, GLONASS, QZSS and BeiDou satellite support

<TabItem value="IO">

The [RAK13002 IO Module](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-interface/products/adapter-module-rak13002) can be used to, among other things, add a user button to the RAK base boards (excluding the RAK19003 Mini base board). It features a number of different interface options:

- 2x I<sup>2</sup>C interfaces
- 2x UART interfaces
- 1x SPI interface
- Upto 6x GPIOs
- 2x ADC interfaces
- 3.3v Power rails


There is development activity in progress to get sensors such as this added to the Meshtastic Core.
