## Buzzer

The [RAK18001 Buzzer Module](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-buzzer-module-rak18001) is currently being tested for integration with the External Notifications plugin. There is currently a known conflict with buzzer if the module is placed in Slot D, although other slots should work.
