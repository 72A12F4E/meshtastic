## Functionality

Button functionality for RAK devices greatly depends on the device specific configuration. If your device has any of the following buttons, the functionality is generally the same for all RAK devices:

- **Reset Button**
	- _**Single press**_ resets the device.
	- _**Double press**_ sets the Device in bootloader mode and mounts a drive to your computer (nRF52 devices only)
- **Power Button**
	- _**Long press**_ powers the device off or turns it back on again.
- **Program button**
	- _**Single press**_ changes the page of information displayed on the screen.
	- _**Double press**_ sets the Bluetooth pairing code to `123456` (useful if you do not have a screen on the device).
	- _**Long press**_ adjusts the contrast of the screen.
	- _**Long press during reboot**_ turns on the software WiFi access point on devices that support WiFi. (ESP32 devices only)
