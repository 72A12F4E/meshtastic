Modules are included in the firmware and allow users to extend the functionality of their mesh or device.

| Name | Description |
|:----:|:-----------:|
| [Canned Message](docs/settings/config/canned-message) | Set a number of predefined messages to send out directly from the device with the use of an input device like a rotary encoder. |
| [External Notification](docs/settings/config/external-notification) | Incoming messages are able to alert you using circuits you attach to the device (LEDs, Buzzers, etc) |
| [MQTT](docs/settings/config/mqtt) | Forward packets along to an MQTT server. This allows users on the local mesh to communicate with users on another mesh over the internet. |
| [Range Test](docs/settings/config/range-test) | Send messages with GPS location at an interval to test the distance your devices can communicate. Requires (at least) one device set up as a sender and one as a receiver. The receiver(s) will log all incoming messages to a CSV. |
| [Serial Module](docs/settings/config/serial) | Send messages across the mesh by sending strings over a serial port. |
| [Telemetry](docs/settings/config/telemetry) | Attach sensors to the device and transmit readings on a regular interval to the mesh. |
