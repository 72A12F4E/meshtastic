Configuration for Meshtastic devices has been completely overhauled in version 1.3.  

In order to facilitate a more stable admin channel for remote management of nodes we have broken our large monolithic config structure into six sections that can be saved individually, protecting our precious mesh bandwidth.

Default settings values are prefered whenever possible as they consume no bandwidth when sent over the mesh.

## Config Sections

Meshtastic config is now broken into 6 sections. Device, Display, LoRa, Position, Power and WiFi.

## Module Config

Meshtastic includes the following modules: Canned Messages, External Notification, Range Test, Serial, Store & Forward and Telemetry (sensors).
