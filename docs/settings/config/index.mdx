title: Config Sections Overview
sidebar_label: Config Sections

There are six config sections in the Meshtastic firmware, these are broken out so they can be sent as small admin messages over the mesh.

Default settings values are prefered whenever possible as they consume no bandwidth when sent over the mesh.
