## Overview

Mesh Networking: An interconnected network by using [low-power radios](/docs/hardware) to connect other low-power radios using LoRa to be able to send and receive messages and data. This can be completely separate from any other networks such as the internet. You can start small and get two devices to start experimenting. Do not expect to stream music or videos as LoRa is intended for smaller, lower bandwidth type uses such as text communication.

As of 1.2 you can connect up to 32 devices to the network. In 1.3 we are working on having 64-80 devices connected to the network.
