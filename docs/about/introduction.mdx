MeshtasticÂ® is a project that enables you to use inexpensive LoRa radios as a long range off-grid communication platform in areas without existing or reliable communications infrastructure. This project is 100% community driven and open source!

### Features

- No phone required for node to node communication.
- Encrypted communication
- Excellent battery life (LoRa radios have a very low power draw)
- Send and receive text messages between members of the mesh
- Enable optional GPS based location features
- And more!

## How it works

The underlying technology, LoRa is a long range radio protocol that is available to most regions without needing certification like HAM operators.

The radios automatically rebroadcast messages they receive in order to create a mesh network so that everyone in the group can receive messages - even from the furthest member. Depending on settings used, the Meshtastic mesh can sustain up to 80 device nodes.

Radios can be paired to a single phone so that your friends and family are able to address a message to your specific radio. Each device supports a connection from a single user at a time.

<!--- FIXME: too technical for intro ?
When you send a message on your Meshtastic companion app, it is relayed to the radio using Bluetooth. That message is then broadcast by the radio three times over a certain interval in order to create redundancy for lost packets.

When a receiving radio captures a packet, it checks to see if it has heard that message before. If it has it ignores the message. If it hasn't heard the message, it will rebroadcast it at a certain interval three times.

For each message a radio rebroadcasts, it marks the "hop limit" down by one. When a radio receives a packet with a hop limit of zero, it will not rebroadcast the message.
