## Overview

### Why does only one RAK Meshtastic Starter kit show up in my node list?

There was a bug where Meshtastic Starter kits were sent out with the same MAC address. With a single MAC address the devices all report as being the same device. Without the battery connected, flash the starter kit device(s) to 1.2.59 and then do a factory reset, disconnect and reconnect the board and run `meshtastic --info`.
