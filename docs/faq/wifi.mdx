## Overview

### How do I turn on the WiFI radio?

[See our guide here](/docs/settings/wifi).

### When I turn on WiFi, Bluetooth turns off. Why is this?

Currently WiFi and Bluetooth can not be enabled at the same time.

### Why does my device lose connection to WiFi?

It could be a couple of things. First, check that the node connects to WiFi on battery power. There are sometimes issues if your power supply is not compatible. Another possibility is [misconfigured DTIM](https://homenetworkadmin.com/what-is-dtim/) on the WiFi network.
