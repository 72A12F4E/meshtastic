## Overview

### Why does my device flag Meshtastic Flasher as having malware?

The flasher contains no malware and completely passed the Microsoft malware scanning. It appears that a lot of file download services are using the Windows Defender data, so if you're seeing alerts of a detected trojan please [update your Windows Defender definitions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/defenderupdates).
