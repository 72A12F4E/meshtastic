Meshtastic uses the [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org) development environment, that enables easy multiplatform development and centralized tooling.

## Setup

1. Install PlatformIO, following the instructions available [here](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide).

2. Clone the `firmware` repository located [here](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware). ([Instructions on cloning](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository))

3. Clone the [Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)

   ```shell
   git submodule update --init
   ```

4. Some utilities and scripts use the Python programming language, Downloads available [here](https://www.python.org/downloads).

## Building

1. Open the newly cloned folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
1. To select the device you you wish to build for, first open your [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) (windows: `Ctrl + Shift + P` or mac: `command + Shift + P` ) and enter: `platformio: Switch Project Environment` and select your target.
1. To build the firmware, simply run `PlatformIO: Build` from your command palette.
1. Finally flashing the firmware to your device is as easy as running `PlatformIO: Upload`

## Adding your own Hardware

The build system is modular. Adding a new board variant for an already supported architecture is straigtforward.

### Building for your own DIY hardware or mod that you don't want to distribute

1. go to the `variants` folder in the firmware sourcecode and make a new directory for your hardware, let's call it `m5stack_atom` and copy an existing configuration you wanna modify

   ```shell
   cd variants; mkdir m5stack_atom
   cp heltec_v1/* m5stack_atom
   cd m5stack_atom
   ```

2. modify the `platformio.ini` _in this subdirectory_ from the canonical define of the hardware variant (`HELTEC_V1` in this case) to `PRIVATE_HW` and make the `-I` on the `build_flags` point to the newly created dir.

   ```shell
   [env:m5stack-atom]
   extends = esp32_base
   board = m5stack-atom
   monitor_filters = esp32_exception_decoder
   build_flags =
      ${esp32_base.build_flags} -D PRIVATE_HW -I variants/m5stack_atom
   lib_deps =
      ${esp32_base.lib_deps}
   ```

3. edit the `variant.h` file _in this subdirectory_ to reflect the defines and configurations for your board. The example is very well commented.
4. build, run and debug until you are satisfied with the result.

### Adding a new off-the-shelf or DIY hardware that you want to distribute (e.g. add a new canon board)

1. do all of the above until your hardware runs fine
2. [Send in a proposal to add a new board](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement%2Ctriage&template=New+Board.yml&title=%5BBoard%5D%3A+)
3. if approved, go to (https://github.com/meshtastic/protobufs) and send a Pull Request for the mesh.proto file, adding your board to the HardwareModel enum.
4. change your define in `platformio.ini` from `PRIVATE_HW` to `YOUR_BOARD`. Adjust any macro guards in the code you need to support your board.
5. add your board identifier to `configuration.h` on the firmware repo and send in that Pull Request too.
6. wait for the Pulls to be merged back into Master.
7. profit :-)
