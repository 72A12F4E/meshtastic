*** WARNING ***

READ ME

Meshtastic 1.3 is currently highly experemental. While we believe that it's stable-ish, 
it's not yet complete.

If you're reading this and want to experement with Meshtastic 1.3, you must be an 
enthusiast and are OK with being fustrated and things not working.

Once Meshtastic 1.3 is stable, we will make the first public and generally available
 version Meshtastic 2.0. If you want the latest and greatest and something stable, please wait for Meshtastic 2.0.

This page will function as a cheat-sheet to keep our notes on how to work with Meshtastic 1.3.

## Known Limitations

* Meshtastic 1.3 will not work with older versions of Meshtastic. All clients and device nodes on your Meshtastic Network will need to run 1.3.
* OTA updates don't work. We don't have an ETA of when this will be implemented. To update device firmware, you will need to use a cable.
