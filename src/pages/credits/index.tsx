            Meshtastic is community driven. Thousands of hours have been donated
            by volunteers who want to develop this amazing project. Whether
            you've submitted a pull request or triaged a bug in our
            Discord/Forum. You've made Meshtastic possible. Thank you for your
            contributions.
          </p>
          <p>
            We would also like to recognize those who have donated financially
            to the project. As Meshtastic has grown, we've aquired some ongoing
            costs to keep the project running. Thank you for your generous
            donations.
