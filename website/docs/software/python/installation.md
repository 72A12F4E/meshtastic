This small library provides a command line interface for Meshtastic nodes and provides an easy API for sending and receiving messages over mesh radios, in addition to changing user settings. Using the command line is currently the most powerful w. Events are delivered using a publish-subscribe model, and you can subscribe to only the message types you are interested in.

[Full documentation](https://meshtastic.github.io/Meshtastic-python) for the library, including examples, is available.

If you wish to view the code or contribute to development of the python library or the command line interface, please visit the Meshtastic python <a href="https://github.com/meshtastic/Meshtastic-python">GitHub page</a>.

Installation is easily done through the [Python package installer pip](https://pypi.org/project/meshtastic/):
:::note
You must use pip version 20 or later. To upgrade to the latest pip, do: `pip install --upgrade pip`

* Load Termux and update the package list
    ```
    pkg update
    ```
* Upgrade the installed packages
    ```
    pkg upgrade
    ```

:::note 
Be aware that the Meshtastic CLI is not able to control the nodes over USB through termux, but you can control devices over wifi using the `--host x.x.x.x` option with the device IP address. However, only ESP32 devices can use wifi currently.
