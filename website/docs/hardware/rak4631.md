The RAK WisBlock is a low power modular hardware system that can be used to build Meshtastic devices.  Soldering is only required for the OLED screen.

You will need a [base board](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base), a [core 4631 LPWAN module](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core/products/rak4631-lpwan-node) and optionally a [1910 GPS sensor](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-sensor/products/rak1910-max-7q-gnss-location-sensor) to build a Meshtastic device.

Both available base boards ([5005](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base/products/rak5005-o-base-board) & [19003](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base/products/wisblock-base-board-rak19003)) have a reset button, support an OLED screen, and have built in connectors for a 3.7V LIPO battery (max 4.3V) and 5V Solar panel (max 5.5V)

A user button is not possible with the 19003 base board, it may be possible to add a user button to the 5005 base board using the [13002 IO module](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-interface/products/adapter-module-rak13002).

The RAK 1910 GPS is supported on slot A of the 5005 board currently.

Flashing the firmware is a simple process connect your device via usb and click the reset button twice and a drive will appear on Windows Linux or Mac drag the appropriate .uf2 firmware file onto the root of the drive and the firmware will be updated.

There is currently no pin required to pair RAK devices via BLE.
