The RAK WisBlock is a low power nrf52 based modular hardware system that can be used with Meshtastic.  

You need a base board, a core 4631 LPWAN module and optionally a 1910 GPS sensor to build a Meshtastic device.

Currently the onboard reset button and OLED screen are supported by both base boards. 

The RAK 1910 GPS is supported on slot A currently which is only available on the 5005 base board.

A user button has not yet been implemented on either RAK base board and is not possible on the small 19003 base board.
